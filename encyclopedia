------ RUST ------
$ rustc (file to open)
$ ./(executable file)

for new projects, in rust directory: 
    $ cargo new _____
    $ cd _____
    ($ cargo build)  -- or just when you run it the first time is ok

for switching projects, in terminal cd ../(program)

To learn about dependencies: cargo doc --open

./target/debug/hello_cargo, cargo run, or check(compile without executable)
when done, cargo build --release

1. Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.

2. println! calls a Rust macro. If it called a function instead, println (no !)

3. "Hello, world!" string passes as argument to println!, and the string is printed to the screen.

4. Semicolon line enders are common (;).

5. Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words, 
and underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability

Variables
    let foo = 5; // immutable
    let mut bar = 5; // mutable

Enumerables - Variants
    Result - Ok, Err
    Ordering - Less, Greater, Equal
use std::io;    io: input output library, from standard lib

.gen_range(1..101);   inclusive on lower, exclusive on upper. alternatively: 1..=100

------ JAVASCRIPT ------
(var) (name) = (argument) =>    /// (var) (attempt) = function(argument) {

Reverse string 
.split() - splits elements of a string into an array
.reverse() - reverses the elements in an array
.join() - joins the elements into a new string

push pop - add remove to end 
unshift shift - add remove to start

for ... of - for loop but maintains indeces
for ... in - for loop without indices

.map and .match are king

------ REGEX ------

------ NIFTY TRICKS ------
_______for loop that starts partway through but loops back around
var myArry = ["cool", "gnarly", "rad", "farout", "awesome"];
var offset = 3;
for( var i=0; i < myArry.length; i++) {
    var pointer = (i + offset) % myArry.length;
    console.log(myArry[pointer]);
}

_______Remove spaces from string
.replace(/\s/g, '')
