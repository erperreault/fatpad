    As you can see, it's an unorganized mess that will get cleaned up as I 
    develop a more clear understanding of programming and my path.

------------------------------ About My Learning ------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What: Primarily Javascript, exploring C++, fascinated by game dev.

When: Set off full time self-study since July 20, 2021, and I haven't looked back.

Why: This is the most important question.
• I look forward to spending time doing this every day. 
    My lifestyle with coding feels in sync. This is everything.
    Joy and results come together from a balance of effort and environment.
• I want to work in a team. 
    Discovering that coding is not only collaborative, but a social and human
    form of art fascinates and motivates me beyond explanation.
• This stuff is in my blood.
    Who knows why. It doesn't matter where I go or what I do in life..
    Games and coding, my joy for these weird electronic creations - it is in my core. 

How:
Main Focus

• Daily leetcode and codewars problems (deconstructive approach)
• Lots of personal projects to start soon (constructive approach)
• learncpp.com for C++ (fundamentals and knowledge base)

Supplemental

• Learning some Unreal Engine 5 once I get more comfortable with C++
• UE5 tutorials https://youtu.be/gQmiqmxJMtA
• https://cs50.harvard.edu/
• FreeCodeCamp projects 
• TheOdinProject projects (mostly just skimming the reading, using for project practice
• https://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html 
• Design Dive Discord Community for game design - current game devs active and weekly talks

---------------------------------- About Me -----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name's Michael Perreault, 29 year old US/Canadian dual citizen 
currently living in Sweden after 6 years in Japan.

I spent my 20s pushing myself to succeed at countless difficult situations.
As a result, I know these things:
1. I can learn anything. I can teach it, and I can get them excited about it.
2. I love people, communication and collaboration.
3. Joy and results come together from a balance of effort and environment.

Through that time games, esports, and communities I could stay in touch with online wherever 
I went were the steady joy that colored the rest of my irrefutably colorful life. 
It was what I would always come back to and what kept me stable when nothing else about my day-to-day was.
It became clear that this was the environment I should be putting my efforts into.

Timeline: 
- Studied Astrophysics @ Virginia Polytechnic Institute 2010.
- Graduated Philosophy / International Studies double major at Virginia Commonwealth University in 2014.
- Background in community service and local development led to bikeandbuild.org across the US for affordable housing.
- Completed the Shikoku Pilgrimage on foot and lived in Japan for 6 years. During which I: 
    • Self-taught business-level fluency Japanese in two years.
    • Co-founded and ran for 3 years the massively successful biketourjapan.com
    • Began a successful freelance career of videography, photography, and web design.
    • Worked with coffee shops, libraries, tourism bureaus, guest houses across Japan: maikerupero.smugmug.com
    • Worked as a private educator and also as a translator.
    • Worked for tech startup stak, Inc. in Hiroshima, Japan - first opportunity to code.
- Moved to Sweden during the pandemic and decided to commit myself full-time to studying programming.
