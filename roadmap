------ Towards the Future ------
Keep in Mind:
> Concrete Projects of my own
> Concrete opensource projects & contributions
> Specific language and field I find interesting
> Gamedev, webdev

------ August 2021 ------
Goal: 
> Continue growing fluency with coding through puzzles and problems. 
    > Explore different sites and formats to grow flexibility.
> Explore interest in C, C++, Rust
    > 8/12 Rust has been frustrating to say the least. though interesting to learn about core
     CS concepts and stuff, but just getting it to work with simple functions in VSC has been a headache.
> Start work on one personal project
> Start contributing work on one opensource shared project
> 8/12 - Let's do this course! https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/


------ JULY 2021 ------ (Began July 20th)
> Get started with learning to deconstruct. i.e. solve problems that are set up for me. codewars etc.
> Move with JS according to bro's advice.
    • Weird language lots of people who learned a different language hate switching to
    • Growing language
    • Good for easily sharing anything I build in the future via browser.
> Get ready to begin practicing construction i.e. projects and github open source
> Assemble resources and a general plan to move forward, education, money, location, curriculum, timing.
